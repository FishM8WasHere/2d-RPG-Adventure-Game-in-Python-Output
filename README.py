# so first we make a list of our list, then make a list inside of a list like: [[], [], []]
# repeat the .append to the list by range(y) first then range(x)

# lets say the empty square value is [' ']
# and our player spawn with the ['A'] square :)

# sorry i kept disconecting my flashdisk while typing ....

# then we assign our player x, y to our current map that shows in the output
# do a loop, then if the player moves (using input (w,a,s,d) then enter), we assign the old position
# then delete from the current map by a for loop, and .append our A square/player square to the
# new square in the map on our output :) 

# also i kept always do some typo

# lets run it!
# uhh, what?

# protip: dont ever use random int.... :V

# ill fix some bugs but thats all cya in the later videos :)
# code will be on my github :)
